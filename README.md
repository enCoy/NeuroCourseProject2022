Idea: We proposed and test a low-dimensional model of emotion processing in the brain, with the goal of evaluating the plausibility of the circumplex model of affect. Our model hypothesizes that the neuronal populations which are responsible for emotion response can be jointly represented in a low-dimensional embedding, which encodes the important information for valence, arousal, and dominance circuits in the
brain. We use EEG signals collected from human subjects who were shown a variety of audiovisual stimuli, together with the subjectsâ€™ self-reported valence, arousal, and dominance scores, to learn such an embedding. Then, to verify that this embedding indeed captures important information about human emotional responses, we use a separate set of collected EEG recordings to study properties of the latent space and to assess if these latent embeddings are predictive of experienced emotions. Despite struggling to differentiate some more nuanced emotional
responses, our results give credence to the three-dimensional circumplex model by showing that a low-dimensional coding scheme that is based on valence, arousal, and dominance scores is indeed predictive of some basic emotions.
